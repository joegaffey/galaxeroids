Galaxeroids
-----------

Galaxeroids is my entry to the 2017 GitHub [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017).

It was created entirely in-browser using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for code and [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) for graphics.

You can [play it here](https://joegaffey.github.io/galaxeroids/). 

Thanks to [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) for general rendering and animation duties and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/Plugins/PixiPlugin) for the alien attack animations.

It reuses some original code and assets from my first attempt at a retro game [Invaders from... Space!](https://github.com/joegaffey/invaders).

The app uses uncompiled ES6 (view source) so it requires a fairly  modern browser. I test it (sometimes) in Chrome (Windows, Android), Firefox (Windows) and Edge. 

Thanks to [Classic Gaming](http://www.classicgaming.cc) for the [sound effects](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds)!
